Infinite Scrolling for Vanilla Forums

This plugin hijacks the pagination, loads the next set of posts or discussions and updates the URL when the user reaches the end of the page.

The plugin indicates the current position in a thread with a progress bar and adds a fixed navigation box that enables users to freely jump to any page without reloading.

Users may also choose to disable infinite scrolling in their profile.

* Overall smoother experience

* Page navigation on discussion lists
* Tested with the most popular themes
