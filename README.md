Infinite Scrolling for Vanilla Forums

This plugin hijacks the pagination and reloads the next set of posts or discussions und updates the URL when the end (or the beginning) of the page is reached.

For a better reading experience, a progress bar is shown at the top of the page, so readers of a discussion don't get lost.  
Users may also choose in their profile if they want to disable infinite scrolling (activated by default).

Aditionally, this plugin adds the option to make the Panel (sidebar) sticky.
